# SQL-for-Data-Analysis-Ecommerce-Dataset-Exploration-with-MySQL
As part of my SQL learning journey, I worked on an ecommerce dataset using MySQL to explore real-world data through SQL queries. 
This task involved:
âœ… Filtering with SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
âœ… Using aggregate functions like SUM, AVG
âœ… Writing subqueries for deeper analysis
âœ… Creating VIEWS for customer insights
âœ… Optimizing queries with INDEXES
âœ… Simulating JOINs with a product reference table
This hands-on task helped strengthen my understanding of data manipulation and query optimization in SQL.
